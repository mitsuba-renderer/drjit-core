//   Optional hack for GCC and Clang: only import headers up to AVX2+ but
//   exclude AVX512.
//
//   This is useful for projects that don't use AVX512 intrinsics but still
//   wish to benefit from the higher register count and instruction encoding.
//   The full set of AVX512 intrinsics pulls in a truly terrifying amount of
//   header code: 1.7 MiB on Clang and 1.2 MiB on GCC, whereas the alternative
//   below only needs 303 KiB on Clang and 237 KiB on GCC.
//
//   GCC/Clang really don't want us to include subsets of the intrinsics and
//   even try to detect this to error out. The code below represents the next
//   step of escalation in this game: we mess up their detection macros so that
//   these checks no longer work. Take that!
